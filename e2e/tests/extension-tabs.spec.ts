 * expansion, so the panel that installs extensions was one tab away from a tab
 * strip that could not see the install. The server now publishes which channel
 * names have a listener (`CHANNEL_WATCH`), and this asserts the consequence:
 * the strip changes with the panel open, in both directions.
 *
 * The extension is installed over the CLI rather than through the Extensions
 * panel because the panel's registry is a network service in one harness and a
 * local port in the other. What is under test is the browser noticing, not
