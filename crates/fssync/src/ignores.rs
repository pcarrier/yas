//! Configurable exclusion for a synced root (docs/design/fs-watch.md
//! "Ignoring").
//!
//! Three sources, composed into one matcher and evaluated per path:
//!
//! - **`.git`** — a pure name filter, no git data read.
//! - **ignore files** — the enclosing worktree's exclude stack: every
//!   `.gitignore` / `.ignore` from the worktree top down to the deepest
//!   directory on the path, plus `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` and the user's
//!   `core.excludesFile`.
//! - **client patterns** — gitignore syntax, anchored at the sync root,
//!   highest precedence so `!keep-this` re-includes what the rest hide.
//!
//! Precedence is git's: the deepest ignore file wins over shallower ones,
//! a match on an ancestor *directory* excludes everything below it (which
//! is why a negation cannot resurrect a file under an excluded directory),
//! and client patterns sit above the whole stack.
//!
//! Filtering is not a view over a full index — an excluded path is never
//! stated, indexed, hashed, or counted against the entry budget, and its
//! hints are dropped before the settle tick. That is the whole point: a
//! sync of a checkout should cost the checkout, not `node_modules`.
