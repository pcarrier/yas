//! Drop retransmissions of the peer's final DTLS handshake flight.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! str0m's DTLS backend (`dimpl`) keeps inbound datagrams in a receive queue
//! and frees them from the *front* only, in sequence order
//! (`purge_handled_queue_rx`).  A record that is never marked handled therefore
//! pins the head of that queue and stops it draining at all.
//!
//! A ChangeCipherSpec is exactly such a record.  `dimpl` consumes the first CCS
//! in `await_change_cipher_spec` and sweeps whatever CCS copies are queued at
//! that instant (`drop_pending_ccs`), but once the handshake state machine has
//! moved on nothing ever looks for a CCS again.  A CCS that arrives *after*
//! that point is queued and never handled.
//!
//! DTLS retransmits the final flight routinely — on loss, on a flight timeout,
//! or when the peer sees a duplicate of our own flight — and str0m coalesces it
//! as `[ChangeCipherSpec][Finished]` in a single datagram.  So the late CCS is
//! not an edge case: in practice it arrives on essentially every session.
//!
//! The result is that the receive queue stops draining, every subsequent record
//! accumulates behind the pinned CCS, and at `max_queue_rx` (30) `dimpl` fails
//! the whole session with `ReceiveQueueFull`.  Sessions died after ~29 inbound
//! records — a handful of seconds of use, or one large response — which made
//! every `yas … --on share:…` invocation pay a fresh ~3.5 s ICE+DTLS setup and
//! truncated any transfer bigger than a few packets.
//!
//! # What we do
//!
//! WebRTC never renegotiates DTLS, so once the handshake is up an epoch-0
//! ChangeCipherSpec can only be a retransmission of a flight already processed
//! in full.  After str0m reports `Event::Connected` we drop any datagram that
//! leads with one.  The duplicate `Finished` coalesced behind it goes too, but
//! UDP delivers a datagram whole or not at all, so nothing is lost that we did
//! not already have.
//!
//! The gate is str0m's own `Event::Connected` ("we got ICE connection and
//! established DTLS") rather than anything derived from the packets themselves.
//! That matters for more than tidiness: this filter runs on raw socket bytes,
//! *before* `Receive::new` parses them and before str0m does ICE source
//! validation or checks a MAC.  Nothing an unvalidated datagram contains may
//! influence what we do with a later one, or an off-path packet that merely led
//! with `0x14` could make us discard the genuine handshake flight and stall the
//! session — a failure mode that did not exist before this filter.  Hence
//! [`DtlsFlightDedupe::accept`] takes `&self`: inbound bytes cannot mutate it.
//!
//! Before `Connected` every CCS is passed through untouched, so no handshake —
//! including one recovering from loss — can be blocked.  This is also why the
//! gate is not "we have seen a CCS already": the retransmission arrives before
//! the DataChannel opens but *after* DTLS completes, so `Connected` is both
//! early enough to catch it and late enough to be safe.
//!
//! Remove this once `dimpl` discards stale epoch-0 ChangeCipherSpec records the
//! way it already discards stale epoch-0 handshake records.
