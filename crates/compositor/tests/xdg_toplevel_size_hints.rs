//! `set_min_size` / `set_max_size` say what the client can actually draw.
//!
//! We cannot resize a pane to suit a client -- the pane is the viewer's
//! layout -- but we can stop quoting a size it is going to refuse, and we owe
//! it the protocol errors xdg-shell specifies for a nonsense pair.  Both
//! halves are double-buffered, so the pair is judged at commit, not as each
//! arrives.
//!
//! The hints also decide how large the composite comes out.  A client that
//! will not draw itself below some width draws past a narrower pane, and
//! compositing at the pane's width would cut off whatever it drew there.
