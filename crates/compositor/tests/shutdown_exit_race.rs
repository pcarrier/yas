//! Teardown overlapping process exit must not be fatal.

//! `stop()` on a thread the caller then walks away from leaves renderer
//! teardown running while this binary exits.  That overlap has killed the
//! process twice, by two separate mechanisms:
//!
//! - `vkDestroyInstance` had the loader `dlclose()` its layer and ICD
//!   libraries, stranding the thread-local destructors they had registered,
//!   and the next thread to exit jumped into freed memory.  Fixed by leaking
//!   the instance.
//! - the NVIDIA driver's own `atexit` handler frees the driver-global state
//!   `vkDestroyDevice` is walking on the compositor thread.  Fixed by an
//!   `atexit` barrier that holds exit until teardown leaves the driver.
//!
//! Its own test binary, so nothing delays the exit and closes the window.
//! Nothing to assert -- surviving is the result.  A regression shows up as
//! this binary exiting with signal 11.
