//! Output globals are owner-filtered: `can_view` hands a `wl_output` only to
//! the client whose toplevel it describes.  Withdrawing one must stay just as
//! private -- a client that never saw the global must never be told it went
//! away.
//!
//! It is not a cosmetic leak.  `wl_registry.global_remove` names a global a
//! client has no entry for, and a client that keeps a map keyed by registry
//! name has nothing to remove.  xwayland-satellite unwraps exactly that lookup
//! (`src/server/mod.rs`, `globals_map.remove(&global).unwrap()`), so one
//! foreign toplevel closing panics the bridge and takes every X11 application
//! in the session with it.
