//! Middle-click paste is between two Wayland clients or it is nothing.
//!
//! The clipboard gets away without compositor-side plumbing: a selection is
//! read out to the browser as text and comes back as an external offer when
//! the user pastes, so the round trip carries it from one app to another.
//! PRIMARY has no such detour -- the web platform exposes no primary
//! selection, so there is nothing to bounce off.  Unless the compositor
//! hands the source to the other client itself, a middle click lands on a
//! selection that exists and cannot be reached, which from the app's side is
//! indistinguishable from no selection at all.
//!
//! These tests run two independent connections, because one client is
//! exactly the case that cannot fail: the owner does not need to be told
//! about its own selection.
