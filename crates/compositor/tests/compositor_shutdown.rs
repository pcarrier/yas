//! Stopping the compositor must not take the process down with it.

//! Renderer teardown used to end in `vkDestroyInstance`, where the Vulkan

//! registered thread-local destructors on every thread that touched them.
//! Unmapping them left those destructors dangling, so a thread exiting
//! afterwards jumped into freed memory.  The instance is now leaked on

//! If this regresses, the symptom is the whole test binary exiting with
