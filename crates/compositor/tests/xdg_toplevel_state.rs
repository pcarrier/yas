//! A toplevel that asks to change state must get an answer, and the answer
//! has to be the one the client can live with.
//!
//! Panes are permanently activated and maximized, so minimize and maximize
//! are declined -- but silence is not a way to decline.  xdg-shell requires a
//! configure in reply to the maximize/fullscreen pair, and Chromium-based
//! clients (every Electron app) flip themselves to minimized the instant they
//! send set_minimized, then stop drawing until a configure carrying
//! `activated` tells them otherwise.
//!
//! Fullscreen is the one that is granted: a pane already fills its output, and
//! a client told otherwise undoes the fullscreen it just entered.
