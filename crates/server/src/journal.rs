//! Per-command terminal journal driven by OSC 133 semantic-prompt markers
//! (docs/design/term-journal.md).
//!
//! A shell with shell integration enabled brackets each command with four
//! markers: `A` when the prompt starts, `B` when the prompt ends and typing
//! begins, `C` just before the command execs, and `D` when it finishes,
//! optionally carrying the exit status. This module turns that stream into a
//! bounded ring of records, each naming its output as a range of sequences
//! ([`yas_terminal_driver::TerminalDriver::seq_text`]) rather than of grid rows,
//! so a record stays readable until the scrollback actually evicts it.
//!
//! Shells emit subsets of the markers, emit them in the wrong order after an
//! interrupt, and sometimes emit none at all. Every transition below is
//! therefore total: there is no input sequence that leaves the machine stuck
//! or that loses a record, and a terminal whose shell emits nothing keeps an
//! empty journal at no cost.
