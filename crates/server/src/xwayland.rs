//! X11 applications on the headless compositor, via `xwayland-satellite`.
//!
//! yas's compositor speaks Wayland only, so an X11 client finds no display
//! at all — it does not fall back, it fails to start. `xwayland-satellite`
//! bridges the two: it runs Xwayland rootless, and republishes every X window
//! as an ordinary `xdg_toplevel` on yas's compositor. From the compositor's
//! side the whole X session is one Wayland client with a lot of windows,
//! which is why the compositor gives that one client a single screen (see
//! `CompositorCommand::SetXwaylandPid`).
//!
//! The bridge is optional in the strongest sense: when the binary is not
//! installed nothing here runs, no `DISPLAY` is exported, and the session is
//! exactly what it was before. `YAS_XWAYLAND=0` opts out even when it is.
