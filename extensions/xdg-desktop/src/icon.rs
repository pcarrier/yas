//! Finding the artwork an `Icon=` key names, and turning it into something a
//! browser can draw.
//!
//! The XDG icon-theme spec is a theme-inheritance search with a size-matching
//! rule per directory, driven by an `index.theme` per theme. None of that is
//! implemented here, and deliberately: the panel wants one small square per
//! application, from whatever theme happens to have it, and the difference
//! between the spec's answer and "the best-sized file of that name anywhere on
//! the icon path" is invisible at 2em. What is *not* invisible is the cost —
//! parsing every `index.theme` would be a directory walk and a read per theme
//! before the first icon appears.
//!
//! So the shape is: rank every directory an icon could be in once, then ask the
//! native FS family to stat the ranked candidates in bounded batches and keep
//! the first hit for each name. That is one typed query page and no child
//! process for the usual icon path.
//!
//! Everything here is pure string and byte work so it can be tested natively;
//! the host only ever answers the paths these produce.
