//! A live view of the systemd system and user unit tables, published on a
//! native channel.
//!
//! ```text
//! yas ext run --persist --restart always systemd extensions/dist/systemd.wasm
//! yas @systemd list --scope user
//! yas @systemd watch ssh
//! ```
//!
//! A Wasm guest reaches nothing but YAS packets, so the host view comes from
//! `systemctl list-units` in a native child process (the process family). The
//! child is poked by D-Bus unit signals through `gdbus monitor` where that
//! tool exists and the manager is broadcasting, and polled otherwise; either
//! way the snapshot the extension diffs is `systemctl`'s own answer, so a
//! missed signal costs latency and never correctness.
//!
//! Channel `yas.systemd.v1` carries one JSON object per message from the
//! extension, and bare text commands (`resync`, `filter PREFIX`,
//! `scopes system,user`, `ping`) from the client.
