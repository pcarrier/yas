## Getting started

### Install Nix and direnv

The project uses Nix for all tooling — the Rust toolchain, wasm-pack, pnpm, Node, process-compose, cargo-watch, and everything else. There is no `Makefile` that installs things piecemeal and no list of system dependencies to chase down. One `flake.nix` pins every tool to an exact revision, so every contributor builds with identical versions regardless of OS or distro. If it works in the dev shell, it works in CI.

direnv makes this invisible. Instead of remembering to run `nix develop` every time you `cd` into the repo, direnv evaluates `.envrc`, enters the Nix dev shell, and adds `bin/` to your PATH automatically. Leave the directory and it restores your previous environment. The result: you open a terminal, `cd blit`, and every tool is just there.

**1. Install the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

This is preferred over the official Nix installer because it enables flakes and the nix command out of the box, configures uninstall support, and works reliably on both macOS and Linux without manual `nix.conf` edits.

**2. [Install direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)** and [hook it into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

**3. Allow the `.envrc`:**

```bash
cd blit
direnv allow
```

The first run downloads and builds the toolchain (cached after that). Once you see `blit dev shell`, you're ready.

### Without direnv

If you'd rather not install direnv, you can enter the dev shell manually:

```bash
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

You'll need to re-run this every time you open a new terminal in the repo.

## Quick start

Once you're in the dev shell, start the full stack with hot-reloading:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

This launches the server, gateway, WASM watcher, and Vite dev servers via `process-compose`. See [Dev environment](#dev-environment) for details on what each process does.

## Building and testing

```bash
cargo build                      # debug build, all crates
cargo test --workspace           # all Rust tests
./bin/clippy                     # clippy (CI fails on any warning)
./bin/fmt --check                # formatting check (CI fails on any diff)
./bin/fmt                        # auto-fix formatting
./bin/lint                       # all of the above in one pass
```

`./bin/fmt` runs `cargo fmt` (Rust) and `prettier` (JS/TS/JSON/MD). `./bin/lint` runs fmt check + clippy together — this is what CI runs.

TypeScript (JS workspace — core, react, solid):

```bash
cd js && pnpm install && pnpm test
```

Or individual packages:

```bash
cd js && pnpm --filter @blit-sh/core run test
cd js && pnpm --filter @blit-sh/react run test
```

E2E (Playwright, requires built binaries):

```bash
./bin/e2e
```

CI runs `./bin/lint`, `./bin/tests`, and `./bin/e2e`. These delegate to `nix run .#<task>`, etc.

## Packaging

Every `nix run` target has a corresponding script in `bin/`:

```bash
./bin/build-debs             # .deb packages -> dist/debs/
./bin/build-tarballs         # static tarballs -> dist/tarballs/
./bin/publish-npm-packages   # npm publish @blit-sh/browser, @blit-sh/core, @blit-sh/react, @blit-sh/solid, @blit-sh/solid
./bin/publish-crates         # cargo publish
```

`build-debs` and `build-tarballs` accept an optional output directory argument (default `dist/debs` and `dist/tarballs`).
The version and platform are derived from `flake.nix` and the build host.
Linkage is verified at `nix build` time — Linux binaries must be statically linked and macOS binaries must not reference nix-store dylibs.

Individual packages can also be built directly:

```bash
nix build .#blit-server      # or blit-cli, blit-gateway
nix build .#blit-server-deb  # or blit-cli-deb, blit-gateway-deb
```

There is no `rustfmt.toml` or `.clippy.toml` — default rustfmt, prettier, and `clippy -D warnings` are the style enforcement. `./bin/fmt` runs both formatters in one pass.

## Dev environment

`./bin/dev` starts the full stack with hot-reloading via `process-compose`:

| Process        | What it does                                                      | Default port / socket |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `browser-wasm` | Watches `crates/browser/src` + `crates/remote/src`, rebuilds WASM | n/a                   |
| `server`       | `cargo watch` running `blit-server --release`                     | `/tmp/blit-dev.sock`  |
| `ui`           | Vite dev server for `js/ui/`                                      | `127.0.0.1:10000`     |
| `gateway`      | `cargo watch` running `blit-gateway --release` (pass=`dev`)       | `127.0.0.1:10001`     |
| `website`      | Astro dev server for `js/website/`                                | `127.0.0.1:10002`     |

### Running multiple dev stacks

Every port and socket path is derived from `DEV_INSTANCE` (default `0`). Each instance gets a block of ports at `10000 + (N * 5)`:

| Instance | UI    | Gateway | Website |
| -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 0        | 10000 | 10001   | 10002   |
| 1        | 10005 | 10006   | 10007   |
| 2        | 10010 | 10011   | 10012   |

```bash
DEV_INSTANCE=1 ./bin/dev   # second stack on 10005-10007
```

`bin/dev` prints the concrete addresses on startup. `DEV_INSTANCE` is intentionally unprefixed: blit strips most `BLIT_*` variables from child PTY sessions, but passes everything else through. This means `DEV_INSTANCE` propagates into nested shells so you always know which instance you're inside and can pick a different one. You can also override individual values:

| Variable             | Default (instance 0) | Description                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `DEV_INSTANCE`       | `0`                  | Instance number (0, 1, 2, …)  |
| `BLIT_DEV_SOCK`      | `/tmp/blit-dev.sock` | blit-server Unix socket       |
| `BLIT_DEV_UI_PORT`   | `10000`              | Vite UI dev-server port       |
| `BLIT_DEV_GW_PORT`   | `10001`              | blit-gateway port             |
| `BLIT_DEV_SITE_PORT` | `10002`              | Astro website dev-server port |

## Project structure

Most Rust crates are one or two source files. `blit-cli` is split into five and `blit-webrtc-forwarder` uses a multi-file module tree.

| File                                   | Role                                                                                                                  |

## Code conventions

**Flat crate layout.** Don't introduce deep `mod` trees. If a crate grows, add files at the same level (like `cli/src/agent.rs`) and `mod` them from the root. `blit-webrtc-forwarder` is the one exception with a multi-file module tree.

**Wire protocol changes** touch multiple layers. A new message type requires:

1. Constants and `ServerMsg`/parse case in `remote/src/lib.rs`
2. A `msg_*()` builder function in `remote/src/lib.rs`
3. Server handler in `server/src/main.rs`
4. Client-side handling in `cli/src/agent.rs` (agent subcommands) and/or `cli/src/interactive.rs` (TUI)
5. Update the protocol tables in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Tests live next to the code.** `server/src/lib.rs` has a `#[cfg(test)]` module at the bottom. `cli/src/agent.rs` has its own test module with `MockServer`/`MockPty` — an in-process test harness using Unix socket pairs. Core tests are in `core/src/__tests__/`, React tests in `react/src/__tests__/`.

**Release profile** uses `opt-level = 3`, LTO, `codegen-units = 1`, and `panic = "abort"`. Linux binaries are statically linked via musl; Nix verifies this at build time.

## Versioning and releases

All workspace crates, `js/core/package.json`, `js/react/package.json`, `js/solid/package.json`, and `nix/common.nix` share a single version number. The JS packages live in a pnpm workspace rooted at `js/` with a shared `js/pnpm-lock.yaml`.

Releases go through a three-step process:

1. **Prepare**: `./bin/release-prepare 0.12.0` runs `bin/prepare-release` locally (version bumping, validation, tests), pushes a `release/<version>` branch, and opens a PR against `main`.
2. **Tag**: After the PR is merged, run `./bin/release-tag 0.12.0` to create a signed tag and push it to origin.
3. The `release.yml` workflow triggers on the `v*` tag push. It first verifies the tag signature via the GitHub API — unsigned or unverified tags fail the workflow immediately.

CI on the verified tag builds debs/tarballs, publishes to crates.io and npm, updates the Homebrew tap, and deploys the APT repo.

## CI checks

PRs must be reviewed and pass the following CI checks before merging:

| Check                  | What it covers                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lint`                 | Formatting (`cargo fmt --check` + `prettier --check`) and clippy (`./bin/lint`)                                                            |
| `e2e`                  | Playwright end-to-end tests (`./bin/e2e`)                                                                                                  |
| `dev-check`            | Full-stack smoke test: starts dev services via `process-compose`, waits for health, exercises the CLI, then tears down (`./bin/dev-check`) |
| `test (ubuntu-latest)` | Rust and JS test suite on Ubuntu                                                                                                           |

## Guardrails

- `./bin/lint` is the CI gate (fmt + clippy). Run `./bin/fmt` to auto-fix formatting and `./bin/clippy` to check clippy warnings before pushing.
- The WASM crate (`crates/browser/`) targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — don't add dependencies that pull in `std::net`, `std::fs`, etc.
- `crates/browser/pkg/` is gitignored. It must be built locally (`./bin/build-browser`) before the UI or React tests will work.
- The server uses raw `libc` calls (`openpty`, `waitpid`, `kill`, `ioctl`) — changes to PTY lifecycle code need careful attention to signal safety and fd leaks.
- The background zombie reaper (`waitpid(-1, ..., WNOHANG)` every 5s in the server) can race with `cleanup_pty`'s `waitpid` for the specific child. This is intentional — `cleanup_pty` uses `WNOHANG` so it doesn't block if the reaper already collected the child.

## Wayland compositor (experimental)

The experimental headless Wayland compositor (`crates/compositor/`) is `#[cfg(unix)]` only — it compiles to a stub on Windows. It uses [smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay) and runs as a thread per session.

### How it works

1. When the first PTY in a session is created, `ensure_compositor()` spawns a compositor thread with a calloop event loop.
2. The compositor creates a Wayland listening socket (`/tmp/wayland-N`) and sets `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` in the PTY child environment.
3. GUI apps launched inside the session connect to this socket and create `xdg_toplevel` windows.
4. On each `wl_surface.commit`, the compositor reads the buffer pixels (via SHM or dmabuf) and sends a `CompositorEvent::SurfaceCommit` to the server.
5. The server encodes the pixels as H.264 or AV1 and stores the encoded frame in `last_frames`. The tick loop sends frames to connected browser clients using the same pacing/congestion-control system as terminal updates.
6. Browser clients decode frames via WebCodecs and render to a `<canvas>`.

### Key data flow

```
Wayland app → compositor thread → CompositorEvent::SurfaceCommit
  → server tick: SurfaceEncoder::encode() → last_frames
  → server tick: pacing check → msg_surface_frame → gateway WS → browser
  → browser: SurfaceStore → VideoDecoder → canvas
```

### Surface encoding

`crates/server/src/surface_encoder.rs` wraps seven backends behind a common `SurfaceEncoder` interface:

- **NVENC AV1 / H.265 / H.264** — NVIDIA GPU hardware encoding via FFmpeg
- **H.265 VA-API** — Intel/AMD GPU hardware encoding via FFmpeg/libva
- **H.264 VA-API** — Intel/AMD GPU hardware encoding via FFmpeg/libva
- **AV1 (rav1e)** — software, handles odd dimensions
- **H.264 software (openh264)** — software fallback, max 3840x2160

`BLIT_SURFACE_ENCODERS` is a comma-separated priority list. The server tries each in order and uses the first that succeeds. Default: `nvenc-h265,h265-vaapi,nvenc-av1,av1,nvenc-h264,h264-vaapi,h264-software`. `BLIT_SURFACE_QUALITY` (low/medium/high/lossless) controls rav1e speed/quantizer presets. `BLIT_VAAPI_DEVICE` selects the VA-API render node (default `/dev/dri/renderD128`). `BLIT_CUDA_DEVICE` selects the CUDA device ordinal for NVENC (default `0`).

### Testing surfaces without a browser

```bash
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock start bash
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock send 1 'foot &\n'
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock surfaces          # list surfaces (TSV)
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock capture 1         # screenshot → surface-1.png
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock click 1 100 50    # click at (x, y)
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock key 1 Return      # press a key
blit -s /tmp/blit-dev.sock type 1 'hello'    # type text
```

### Wire protocol surface messages

Surface messages use opcodes `0x20`–`0x28` (S2C) and `0x20`–`0x29` (C2S). See the constants in `crates/remote/src/lib.rs`. A new client receives `S2C_SURFACE_CREATED` for each existing surface during the initial state sync, followed by keyframes via the normal pacing loop.
