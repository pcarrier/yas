# Services

This document describes the hosted services and CI/CD infrastructure that support blit. For the system architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For development workflow, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running as a service

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew services start blit-server
brew services start blit-gateway
```

### Debian / Ubuntu (systemd)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now blit-server@alice.socket

# Share via WebRTC: create /etc/blit/forwarder-alice.env with
# BLIT_SOCK=/run/blit/alice.sock and BLIT_PASSPHRASE=<secret>, then:
sudo systemctl enable --now blit-webrtc-forwarder@alice.service
```

### Multi-remote gateway (blit-gateway)

`blit-gateway` can front multiple remote hosts in a single browser UI.
Configure remotes in `~/.config/blit/blit.remotes` (same file used by `blit open`):

```
rabbit = ssh:rabbit
hound = ssh:alice@hound
```

```bash
BLIT_PASSPHRASE=secret blit-gateway
```

SSH remotes are connected via the embedded SSH client (russh) with
ssh-agent authentication. blit is auto-installed on remote hosts if missing.

To proxy `share:` (WebRTC) remotes through the gateway instead of having the
browser connect to the hub directly, set `BLIT_GATEWAY_WEBRTC=1`:

```
hound = share:mysecret
rabbit = share:anothersecret?hub=wss://custom.hub
```

```bash
BLIT_GATEWAY_WEBRTC=1 BLIT_PASSPHRASE=secret blit-gateway
```

The gateway connects as a WebRTC consumer (using the passphrase-derived channel
identity; the hub assigns each connection a unique sessionId so multiple
consumers can connect to the same forwarder concurrently) and re-exposes each
session at `WS /d/<name>`. The browser never touches WebRTC
or the hub. Without `BLIT_GATEWAY_WEBRTC=1`, `share:` entries are ignored by
the gateway and the browser connects to the hub directly.

### Nix

For nix-darwin and NixOS service modules, see [`nix/README.md`](nix/README.md).

## install.blit.sh

`install.blit.sh` is an APT repository and binary download site hosted on **GitHub Pages**. It is rebuilt and deployed on every tagged release (`v*`). Users interact with it in three ways:

1. **Curl installer** — `curl -sf https://install.blit.sh | sh` fetches the install script (served as `index.html`), which detects OS/arch, downloads the right tarball from `/bin/`, and installs it.
2. **PowerShell installer** — `irm https://install.blit.sh/install.ps1 | iex` installs blit on Windows. Downloads the zip from `/bin/`, extracts `blit.exe` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\blit\bin`, and adds it to the user `PATH`.
3. **APT repository** — Debian/Ubuntu users add it as a signed APT source for `apt install blit`.
4. **Direct download** — tarballs are available at `/bin/blit_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`, Windows zips at `/bin/blit_<version>_windows_x86_64.zip`.

### File hierarchy

```

### How the install script works

[`install.sh`](install.sh) is a portable POSIX shell script that:

1. Detects OS (`uname -s`) and architecture (`uname -m`), normalizing to `linux`/`darwin` and `x86_64`/`aarch64`.
2. Fetches `/latest` from `install.blit.sh` to get the current version.
3. Skips if the installed version already matches.
4. Downloads the tarball from `/bin/blit_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`.
5. Extracts and installs to `$BLIT_INSTALL_DIR` (default `/usr/local/bin`), escalating with `sudo`/`doas` if needed.

### Windows installer

[`install.ps1`](install.ps1) is the Windows equivalent:

1. Fetches `/latest` to get the current version.
2. Downloads the zip from `/bin/blit_<version>_windows_x86_64.zip`.
3. Extracts `blit.exe` to `$BLIT_INSTALL_DIR` (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\blit\bin`).
4. Adds the install directory to the user `PATH` if not already present.

### `blit upgrade`

`blit upgrade` is the in-place self-update command. On Unix it fetches `install.sh` from `https://install.blit.sh`, writes it to a temp file, and `exec`s `sh` with `BLIT_INSTALL_DIR` set to the directory of the currently running binary. On Windows it fetches `install.ps1` and runs it via PowerShell. See [`crates/cli/src/main.rs`](crates/cli/src/main.rs).

### How the site is built

The `apt-repo` job in the release workflow assembles the entire site from build artifacts, signs the APT metadata with GPG, and deploys via GitHub Pages:

```

## hub.blit.sh

`hub.blit.sh` is the WebRTC signaling relay that enables `blit share`. It runs on **Fly.io** and is deployed automatically when code under `js/hub/` changes on `main`.

The hub routes WebRTC signaling messages (offers, answers, ICE candidates) between peers over WebSocket. Channels are identified by ed25519 public keys, and the server verifies NaCl `crypto_sign` envelopes before relaying — no server-side accounts needed.

For protocol details, deployment instructions, and configuration, see [`js/hub/README.md`](js/hub/README.md).

### Architecture

- **Bun** runtime with `Bun.serve()` for HTTP and WebSocket
- **Redis** for cross-instance pub/sub and session tracking (sets with TTL)
- **tweetnacl** for ed25519 signature verification
- Stateless — all session state lives in Redis, so instances scale horizontally

### Endpoints

| Path                                     | Purpose                                                 |

| `/ice`                                   | STUN/TURN server config (Cloudflare TURN if configured) |
| `/message`                               | Session URL template for client display                 |
| `/health`                                | Liveness check (pings Redis)                            |

## blit.sh

`blit.sh` is the public website, deployed to **Vercel**. It serves two purposes:

1. **Landing page** (`/`) — marketing page with install instructions, feature overview, and a join form to connect to a shared session.
2. **Terminal viewer** (`/#<secret>`) — browser-based terminal that connects to a `blit share` session via WebRTC through `hub.blit.sh`.

The site is a Vite + React SPA built from [`js/website/`](js/website/). It consumes `@blit-sh/core` and `@blit-sh/react` via source aliases and inlines the browser WASM module at build time.

### Build and deploy

The website is built as a Nix derivation (`websiteDist` in [`nix/packages.nix`](nix/packages.nix)) which compiles the WASM crate, installs pnpm deps via `fetchPnpmDeps`, and runs `vite build`. The `deploy-website` task in [`nix/tasks.nix`](nix/tasks.nix) assembles a Vercel prebuilt output directory and deploys via `pnpm dlx vercel deploy --prebuilt`.

- **Production deploy** — pushes to `main` that touch `js/website/**`, `js/core/**`, `js/react/**`, or `crates/browser/**` trigger `./bin/deploy-website --prod`.
- **Preview deploy** — PRs with the same path changes get a preview deploy with the URL posted as a PR comment.

### Local usage

```sh
./bin/deploy-website          # preview deploy
./bin/deploy-website --prod   # production deploy
```

## Static binaries via Nix + musl

All release binaries are built with Nix, which makes the entire toolchain reproducible and keeps the build definitions small.

On Linux, binaries are statically linked against **musl libc** via `pkgs.pkgsStatic`. Nix's `pkgsStatic` overlay cross-compiles the entire dependency closure against musl, producing fully self-contained executables with zero runtime dependencies — no glibc version issues, no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, works on any Linux kernel from the past decade. The `mkStaticBin` helper in [`nix/packages.nix`](nix/packages.nix) wraps this and includes a `postFixup` assertion that the output is genuinely statically linked (via `file`), failing the build if it isn't.

On macOS, true static linking isn't practical (Apple doesn't ship static system libraries). Instead, `postFixup` rewrites any nix-store dylib references to their `/usr/lib/` equivalents (`libSystem`, `libc++`, `libresolv`, etc.) using `install_name_tool`, so the binary runs on stock macOS without Nix installed.

The Rust toolchain is configured with musl targets (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`) in [`nix/common.nix`](nix/common.nix). The same toolchain also includes `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for the browser WASM build.

This means the tarballs on `install.blit.sh/bin/` and the binaries inside `.deb` packages are single-file, zero-dependency executables — download, `chmod +x`, run.

On Windows, Nix isn't available, so the `build-windows` job uses `cargo build --release` directly on a `windows-latest` runner with the MSVC toolchain. The resulting `.exe` files link against standard Windows system DLLs (kernel32, ws2_32, etc.) that are always present.

## GitHub Actions workflows

Six workflow files live in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow                                                             | Trigger                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                                             |

### Dev check (dev-check.yml)

Runs on every push to `main` and on every pull request. Single job on `ubuntu-latest`:

1. Installs the latest released `blit` CLI via `install.blit.sh`.
2. Enters the Nix devshell and runs `bin/dev` (process-compose with `cargo watch`, WASM build, gateway, ui, website).
3. Polls `process-compose list` until all five services report Running.
4. Smoke-tests with the `blit` CLI: starts a session, waits for it, verifies output, lists sessions, closes the session.
5. Tears down process-compose.

### Release (release.yml)

Triggered by pushing a `v*` tag. A `verify-tag` job checks the tag signature via the GitHub API before any builds start — unsigned or unverified tags fail the workflow immediately.

### Deploy hub (deploy-hub.yml)

Single job, triggered only when files under `js/hub/` change on `main`:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PUSH["Push to main<br>(js/hub/**)"] --> DEPLOY["nix run .#deploy-hub<br>via flyctl"]
```

### Deploy website (deploy-website.yml)

Builds the website via Nix and deploys to Vercel. Runs on pushes to `main` and on PRs when relevant paths change. PR deploys post a preview URL as a comment.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PUSH["Push to main or PR<br>(js/website/**, js/core/**,<br>js/react/**, crates/browser/**)"] --> BUILD["Nix build<br>websiteDist"] --> DEPLOY["vercel deploy<br>--prebuilt"]
    DEPLOY --> COMMENT["Post preview URL<br>(PRs only)"]
```

### Publish demo image (publish-demo-image.yml)

Builds and pushes `grab/blit-demo` to Docker Hub. Runs on pushes to `main` and on `v*` tags. Tagged releases get an additional version tag.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    TRIGGER["Push to main<br>or v* tag"] --> BUILD_AMD[build-push<br>amd64] & BUILD_ARM[build-push<br>arm64]

## Secrets and authentication

| Secret               | Used by            | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`    | apt-repo           | Signs APT Release metadata                  |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | update-homebrew    | PAT for cross-repo dispatch to homebrew-tap |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN`      | deploy-hub         | Fly.io deploy token for blit-hub            |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | publish-demo-image | Docker Hub credentials                      |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`    | publish-demo-image | Docker Hub credentials                      |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`       | deploy-website     | Vercel API token                            |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID`      | deploy-website     | Vercel organization ID                      |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`  | deploy-website     | Vercel project ID                           |

`publish-crates` uses no stored secret. It authenticates to crates.io via OIDC trusted publishing — GitHub mints a short-lived ID token (enabled by the `id-token: write` permission on the release workflow) and exchanges it for a crates.io upload token. `publish-npm` works the same way, using `--provenance` to sign the npm package with the workflow's OIDC identity.
