/**
 * The resizable-pane half of a surface view, shared by every framework
 * binding.
 *
 * A surface view comes in two shapes.  A *passive* one — a dock card, a
 * switcher preview — is handed a box and asks the server for a fixed
 * downscale of whatever the surface happens to be; `YasSurfaceCanvas`
 * measures that itself.  A *resizable* one owns its surface's size: it
 * reports its box as a display size, which is what puts the view into the
 * server's size mediation and, incidentally, what every input path is gated
 * on (`_displaySize`).  Without it a view is an inert preview: no pointer, no
 * wheel, no keyboard, no IME, and a 15 fps thumbnail-grade stream.
 *
 * That half used to live in each binding, which is how the React one ended up
 * never calling {@link SurfaceResizeTarget.setDisplaySize} at all — a
 * documented, full-window React pane that could not be clicked. One
 * implementation, two thin call sites.
