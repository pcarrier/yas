/**
 * Classification of hyperlink targets that arrive from the terminal.
 *
 * OSC 8 lets an application decouple a link's *text* from its *target*, which
 * is the same primitive that makes `<a href>` phishable: the cell grid can read
 * `https://your-bank.example` while the target is something else entirely. The
 * regex link detection this supplements could not express that — a URL had to
 * literally appear on screen to be clickable — so accepting OSC 8 is what
 * introduces the risk, and it has to be paid for here.
 *
 * Three outcomes, in the spirit of Ghostty's classifier:
 *
 * - `allow`   — a well-known safe scheme with nothing deceptive in it.
 * - `confirm` — plausible but unverifiable: custom schemes, `file:`, embedded
 *               credentials, non-ASCII hosts. The user is shown the real target
 *               and decides.
 * - `deny`    — never openable: script-executing or content-inlining schemes,
 *               and anything containing characters that can hide what the URL
 *               actually says.
 *
 * The invariant this module exists to protect: **no URL is ever rendered to the
 * user as raw text.** Always display `assessment.display`, never
 * `assessment.raw`. A URL that has passed classification can still contain
 * codepoints that reorder or erase neighbouring text when drawn.
