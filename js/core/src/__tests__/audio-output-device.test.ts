 * asks for a large bite of audio at once, so the buffer is drained in bursts
 * and refills between them — and none of the tuning here knows that, because
 * nothing in the pipeline ever consults the output device.
 *
 * These tests hold the producer at a flawless 20 ms cadence and vary only the
 * consumer, so anything they report is self-inflicted.
