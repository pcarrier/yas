// No solid plugin: this suite deliberately covers the app's non-component
// logic — the preview service worker above all, which carries the cookie and
// message-origin rules a previewed page's security depends on. Rendering
// components is @yas-run/solid's job and needs a DOM harness this does not.
//
// Reactive (non-rendering) logic is still in scope, and needs solid-js to
// resolve to its CLIENT build: under node conditions the package resolves to
// the server build, where createEffect is a no-op and every store/watch hook
// silently does nothing. No JSX is involved, so no plugin is implied.
