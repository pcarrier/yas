/**
 * ManageTile — one server's panels as pane content, not as a dialog.
 *
 * The panels used to be a modal stack: the remotes overlay, and on top of it an
 * overlay per remote. That made them the least durable thing on the screen.
 * Anything that closed an overlay closed these too — and one of the things that
 * closes an overlay is a window asking to be raised, which is exactly what
 * happens a second after Enable starts an application. So the panel that
 * launched the app dismissed itself, and the viewer's next click had to walk
 * back in through two dialogs.
 *
 * A pane has none of that: it is a tile like an editor or a terminal, it can be
 * split next to the thing it manages, it survives focus going elsewhere, and it
 * is restored by the same workspace + tab registry as every other tile.
 *
 * One tile per connection, from {@link manageAssignment} — the panels hold live
 * subscriptions (a client watch pushing a catalog every second, a unit table),
 * and two tiles onto one server would run two of each.
