 * yas plays audio entirely through an `AudioContext`, with no `<audio>` or
 * `<video>` anywhere. That is enough for WebKit to publish Now Playing metadata
 * — the iPadOS panel shows the track and artist — but not enough for it to
 * deliver the panel's transport commands: WebKit routes those to a playing
 * `HTMLMediaElement`, and with none present, play/pause fall back to its own
 * handling of the audio context while next/previous have nothing to reach. The
 * page's `setActionHandler` callbacks are registered and simply never fire, so
 * the buttons appear live and do nothing.
 *
 * A silent element playing on loop supplies the missing routing target. It is
 * inaudible and costs one decode of a one-second buffer, but it does claim an
 * audio session, so it runs only while a controllable player is on screen and
 * stops as soon as one is not.
