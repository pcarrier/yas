/**
 * Which tab a server's panels are on — kept here, outside the panels.
 *
 * The panels are pane content ({@link ./ConnectionPanels.tsx}), and a pane can
 * be parked in the dock, which unmounts them. State held inside them is lost at
 * exactly the moment two other readers want it: the dock card, which names the
 * tab the tile is on because that is what a viewer picks the card by, and the
 * restored tile, which should come back on the tab it left.
 *
 * Two values, not one. The pick is what the viewer clicked and may name a tab
 * that has since gone (an extension can be removed while its panel is up); the
 * shown tab is what that resolves to against the set the server actually
 * serves, which only the mounted panels know. Collapsing them would let a
 * fallback overwrite the pick, so a tab that came back would not be returned to.
