/**
 * Persisted browser presentation values for the two surface-video axes, and
 * the words the panel puts on them.
 *
 * The persisted values are also the wire representation and form a small
 * tagged union:
 *
 *   0        server default
 *   1–4      named presets
 *   5–9      reserved; the server reads these as the default
 *   10–255   a raw value
 *
 * The two axes disagree about which way "better" runs, which is the whole
 * reason this module exists:
 *
 * - **bandwidth** presets climb (1 = Low, quantizer 180 … 4 = Ultra, quantizer
 *   1) while its raw range is an AV1 quantizer, where *higher is worse*. A
 *   slider over 10–255 therefore runs backwards from the preset row above it.
 * - **speed** agrees in both (1 = Slow … 4 = Realtime; raw 10 = slowest,
 *   255 = fastest), so it needs no mirroring.
 *
 * See `SurfaceBandwidth::from_wire` / `SurfaceSpeed::from_wire` in
 * crates/server/src/surface_encoder.rs for the other end.
