/**
 * ConnectionSession — the applications ONE connection starts and keeps running:
 * what is enabled, what is actually up, how many windows each has, and controls
 * to run one.
 *
 * Two pairs of verbs, because they answer different questions. Enable/Disable
 * is intent: what this session should be running the next time it starts.
 * Start/Stop is now: try an application without adopting it, or stop one
 * without forgetting it. Collapsing them into one button — which is what this
 * had — makes "stop this for a minute" indistinguishable from "I never want
 * this again".
 *
 * State comes from the `yas.session.v1` native channel served by the session
 * supervisor extension (`extensions/session`), not from a built-in YAS family.
 * A connection whose server runs no supervisor simply shows nothing — the
 * channel connect fails and the section stays out of the way, which is why this
 * renders nothing at all rather than an error when it cannot attach.
 *
 * The channel itself is not this panel's. It belongs to {@link
 * ./sessionCatalogs.ts}, which holds one per connected server for the life of
 * the page so the switcher can search applications without waiting for a
 * catalog. This panel used to open its own and close it on the way out; two
 * mirrors of one supervisor also meant two icon caches filling with the same
 * artwork.

                Bounded by the pane, not the viewport. It was `42vh`, which in
                a dialog capped at 80% of the screen was about right, and in a
                pane is a number unrelated to the box it is in: in a short pane
                it overflows and the pane scrolls too (two scrollbars for one
                list), in a tall one it stops short of the bottom. `flex: 1`
                against a parent with `min-height: 0` is the same intent
                measured against the right thing. */}
