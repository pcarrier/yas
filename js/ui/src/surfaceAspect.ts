/**
 * The shape a surface thumbnail should hold.
 *
 * A dock card gives itself the window's aspect and `height: auto`, so this
 * ratio *is* the card's height. Which of a surface's two sizes it follows
 * therefore decides how often the card's box moves, and a card's box moving
 * costs a server-side encoder rebuild and a keyframe (`refreshScaledTarget`).
 *
 * The composite size (`width`/`height`) is the wrong one. It is the logical
 * size times whatever scale the *highest-DPI viewer* asked for — the server
 * mediates one surface across every viewer at the largest scale any of them
 * wants — floored onto the even 4:2:0 sampling grid. So it is off by up to a
 * pixel on each axis, and it moves when somebody else's display DPI does, for
 * a window that never changed shape. The logical size moves only when the app
 * resizes, which is the only thing a thumbnail should follow.
