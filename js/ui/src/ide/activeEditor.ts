 * The focused tile's chrome (filename, navigation, state, and actions) lives

 *
 * The accessors close over the owning tile's signals, so the StatusBar stays
 * reactive without any prop threading. A controller is cleared when its tile
 * unmounts (see clearActiveEditor), so the StatusBar never reads a disposed
