/**
 * Applying an LSP rename plan (docs/design/lsp.md `LSP_QUERY_RENAME`).
 *
 * The server answers `RENAME` with `EDIT` records and never touches the
 * filesystem, so the client is what makes a rename happen. Each record
 * names the content version it was computed against (`hash`, BLAKE3-128 —
 * the same value the fs family carries as a u128), which is exactly what
 * `writeFile`'s `ifHash` wants: a plan computed against bytes that have
 * since moved is refused rather than applied to the wrong content.
 *
 * The editor applies its own file through CodeMirror (so the rename lands
 * in the undo history); every other file in the plan is opened here as a
 * short-lived single-file sync, rewritten under CAS, and dropped.
