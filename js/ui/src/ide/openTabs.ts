/**
 * The host-wide open-tab list, mirrored from each server's `tabs/` KV prefix
 * (docs/design/kv.md).
 *
 * `tabRegistry.ts` already writes every opened tab to `tabs/<id>`; until now
 * that record was only ever point-read, by `resolveTab`, to expand one hash
 * ref. Watching the prefix instead is what makes the RFC's actual claim true —
 * open files become "always-on server-backed state that a client _views_, not
 * state a client _owns_": every frontend on a host sees the same set of tabs,
 * and a tile that leaves one client's viewport is still listed everywhere,
 * rather than surviving only in that client's session-local dock signal.
 *
 * Values are the bare (connection-less) assignment, so each mirror's entries
 * are re-tagged with the connection they came from. Ordering is by `mtimeNs` —
 * registration is a NO_CAS put on every open, so newest-touched sorts first,
 * which is the recency order the dock already wanted.
 *
 * Degradation matches the rest of the KV consumers: a connection without the
 * native KV family (or one that refuses the watch) simply contributes no
 * entries, and the caller's local fallback list carries the dock alone.
