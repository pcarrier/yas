 * Follow-terminal roots: resolving the pty an IDE session's fs/git/lsp opens
 * hang off (FROM_PTY, docs/ide.md Decision 3 — the server joins the requested
 * path onto that pty's live cwd).
 *
 * The core opens take a `SessionId`, but a SessionId is only valid for one
 * connection generation: every re-establish marks the current sessions closed,
 * mints fresh ids for the same ptys, and prunes the superseded ones
 * (YasConnection.pruneSupersededSessions). An IdeSession is keyed by *pty* and
 * kept warm across reconnects, so the id its descriptor was built with dies
 * under it — and an open that cannot resolve its source is refused, because
 * dropping FROM_PTY would rebase a pty-relative path (the dock's
 * follow-terminal root is `""`) onto the server's own cwd. So the descriptor
 * carries the pty, which is stable, and this resolves the live id from it at
 * every open.
