/**
 * IdeSession — the single owner of IDE state for one workspace root.
 *
 * The old dock opened fs/git/lsp handles per panel and tore them down on
 * every focus change, losing work and re-deriving reactivity by hand. This
 * inverts that: one session per (connection, root) opens fs + git once (lsp
 * on demand), exposes reactive derived state (tree, git status, commit log,
 * diagnostics) and layout-agnostic actions, and is ref-counted + idle-cached in
 * a registry so switching terminals reuses a warm session instead of
 * rebuilding it. Panels become pure views over a session: they never open or
 * close a handle themselves. What a panel does own is a *lease* — the lazy
 * resources (child directory watches, the commit-log walk, the language
 * server) live while some panel holds one, so a section the dock has folded
 * away stops costing the server anything. See `createLease`.
