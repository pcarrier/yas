/**
 * The Branches panel's data, derived from what the repo already streams.
 *
 * Branches cost nothing new: `GIT_STATE` already pushes every ref, HEAD, and
 * (with the `TRACKING` open flag) per-branch ahead/behind, so this is a pure
 * reshaping of the mirror rather than another request. Worktrees do come from
 * a request (`GIT_WORKTREES`), and this module only turns its records into
 * rows — the refetching lives in the session, keyed on the state stream's
 * worktree generation.
 *
 * Kept apart from the component so both derivations are testable without a
 * DOM, which is the only way to pin the ordering rules below.
