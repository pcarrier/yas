/**
 * Embedding entry point: the full yas workspace as a mountable component,
 * for hosts that are not the app shell — yas.run's share page is the first.
 *
 * `App` is the shell: it owns same-origin edge authentication, workspace
 * sessions, and home-server Relay state. None of that holds on a marketing
 * site opening one direct share link.
 * `Workspace` below it never had those assumptions — it takes a list of
 * (id, transport) pairs and renders the whole product — so embedding is a
 * matter of exposing that seam, not of building a second, lesser client.
 * The 900-line reimplementation this replaces on yas.run/s is the argument
 * for doing it this way: it had drifted from the app it imitated.
